##
This content is part of the learning journey through the Java Course by *Curso em V√≠deo*, instructed by Professor Gustavo Guanabara. This repository has been developed for personal tracking of activities and progress in the programming language.

The original course includes content on Java Basic and Object-Oriented Java modules, totaling 80 hours of instructional material. However, since it is a personal study, there will be some additional materials and independent studies.

Furthermore, if it has educational value for you, feel free to join. I'm glad that you're joining me on this learning journey.

The original course is available in Portuguese. To access, click [here](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/).

Note: *All courses by Curso em V√≠deo are free, but the certificate of completion is a paid service.*
